		<p class="text">使馆标志着两国建有外交关系，分为大使馆、公使馆和代表处三个等级，其馆长分别为大使、公使和代办——现在一般都为大使级，所以使馆一般也即为大使馆。</p>
		<p class="text">大使馆是一国在建交国首都派驻的常设外交代表机关。大使馆代表整个国家的利益，全面负责两国关系，馆长一般是大使，也可以是公使或者其他等级的由派遣国委派的外交人员，由国家元首任命并作为国家元首的代表履行职责。</p>
		<p class="text">大使馆的首要职责是代表派遣国，促进两国的政治关系，其次是促进经济、文化、教育、科技、军事等方面的关系，使馆同时具有领事职能。促进两国关系和人民间的往来是领事馆的重要职责，但其最主要的职责是领事工作，比如：维护本国公民和法人在外国的合法权益，向本国公民颁发或延期护照、向外国公民颁发签证等。</p>
		<p class="text">An embassy signifies that two countries have diplomatic relations and it is divided into three levels: embassy, legation and consulate. The heads of these institutions are respectively the ambassador, minister, and chargé d'affaires - now generally at the ambassador level. 
		<p class="text">An embassy is a permanent diplomatic representative institution of one country in the capital of another country with whom they have established diplomatic relations. An embassy represents the interests of the entire country and is responsible for all aspects of the relationship between the two countries. The head of an embassy is usually an ambassador but can also be a minister or other level of diplomat appointed by the sending country’s head of state to act as their representative.</p>
		<p class="text">The primary responsibility of an embassy is to represent the sending country and promote political relations between the two nations, followed by promoting relations in areas such as economics, culture, education, technology, and military affairs. Embassies also have consular functions, which include promoting relations between the two countries and facilitating interactions among their people. However, their main duty is consular work, such as protecting the legal rights and interests of their citizens and legal entities abroad, issuing or renewing passports to their citizens, and issuing visas to foreign citizens.</p>
